Welcome to Newscoop Plugin Development's documentation!
=======================================================

Plugins add extra functionality to Newscoop, an open source News CMS. This documentation shows you how to write plugins and contains simple examples you can use as a starting point.  

.. Plugins let you change Newscoop behavior by:

        * Defining routes for controllers and views
        * Adding hooks in the Admin and Edit panels
        * Managing your database
        * Translating plugins
        * Adding Smarty template blocks and functions
