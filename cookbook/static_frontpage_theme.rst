How to always use one theme for publication frontpage?
------------------------------------------------------

*Minimum Newscoop Version: 4.4.7*

To render pages Newscoop (by default) use theme attached to latest published issue. This behavior works great if you create new issue per week or month and sometimes want to use different theme (for christmas, easter or some other special ocasion).
But if you don't use issues in this way (for example. every issue is separate city or region in your publication) then it can create some problems.

To always use one theme for your frontpage (even if latest published issue use new/different one) you need to change publication settings.

  1. Open your publication settings page (In menu choose Content->Publications and on publications list click "configure" - pencil icon).
  2. In section "Front page theme settings" choose which theme should be used for specific language on frontpage.

      You have there two or more options:

      * Follow current issue theme - this will be selected as default - as it's default Newscoop behaviour.
      * You theme assigned to publication - can be more than one.

  3. Choose preferred option and save settings.
